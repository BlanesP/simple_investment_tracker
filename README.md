# SimpleInvestmentTracker

As a big advocate of the "learn by doing" philosophy, I made this project to practice or learn skills in several areas related to iOS development, such as:

- **SwiftUI + Combine**
- **Core Data + Reactive layer**
- **Unit Testing**
- **MVVM + Clean Architecture**
- *Pending: Publishing to the App Store*
